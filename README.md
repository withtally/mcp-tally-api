# MCP Tally API

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides LLMs with access to Tally's blockchain governance API for querying DAOs, proposals, and voting data across multiple networks.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get started with MCP Tally API in Cursor or Claude Desktop in 2 minutes:

### 1. Get a Tally API Key
Sign up at [Tally.xyz](https://tally.xyz) to get your free API key.

### 2. Install the MCP Server
```bash
npm install -g mcp-tally-api
```

### 3. Configure Cursor/Claude Desktop
Add to your MCP configuration file:

**Cursor:** Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "tally": {
      "command": "mcp-tally-api",
      "env": {
        "TALLY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop:** Edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tally": {
      "command": "mcp-tally-api",
      "env": {
        "TALLY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start Using
Restart Cursor/Claude Desktop and start asking about DAOs:

> "What are the most popular DAOs with active proposals?"  
> "Show me details about Uniswap governance"  
> "Who are the top delegates in Arbitrum DAO?"

üéØ **You now have access to 12 tools and 6 resources for comprehensive DAO governance analysis!**

### Installation

#### **Option 1: Install from npm (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g mcp-tally-api

# Or install locally in your project
npm install mcp-tally-api

# Set up environment
echo "TALLY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

### Running the Server

The MCP Tally API server supports two transport modes:

#### **STDIO Mode (Default)**

For direct integration with MCP clients like Cursor:

**If installed via npm:**
```bash
# Production mode  
TALLY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here mcp-tally-api

# Using environment file
mcp-tally-api  # Uses .env file
```

**If built from source:**
```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
TALLY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here bun run dev

# Production mode
TALLY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here bun run start

# Or using environment file
bun run start  # Uses .env file
```

#### **HTTP Mode**

For web-based integrations and remote access:

**If installed via npm:**
```bash
# Production mode
TALLY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here TRANSPORT_MODE=http mcp-tally-api

# Configure port
TALLY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here PORT=8080 TRANSPORT_MODE=http mcp-tally-api
```

**If built from source:**
```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
TALLY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here bun run dev:http

# Production mode
TALLY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here bun run start:http

# Server runs on http://localhost:3000 by default
# Configure port: PORT=8080 bun run start:http
```
